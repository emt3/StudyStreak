                <h1> How do I earn achievements? </h1>
                <p> Studying can feel like a personal game where each task you 
                    complete earns you points toward your academic goals. Every time you hit 
                    a study milestone—whether it's finishing a chapter, acing a practice quiz, 
                    or completing a set of flashcards—you score points based on your effort and 
                    consistency. These points represent the progress you're making, adding up over 
                    time to unlock personal achievements. Maybe it's earning the title of "Master of 
                    Math" after a tough week of problem sets or becoming the "Flashcard Champion" 
                    for mastering vocabulary. By turning your study habits into a point-based system, 
                    you create a fun and motivating way to visualize your accomplishments, pushing you 
                    to reach the next level of success!</p>

                <h1> How do I keep my deadlines organized? </h1>
                <p> Tracking tasks as a student is like having a trusty sidekick on 
                    your academic adventure! It keeps you organized, helps you dodge 
                    the dreaded deadline monster, and ensures you're always one step ahead.
                    Imagine checking off assignments like a pro—each tick feels like leveling 
                    up in your favorite game! Plus, it turns chaotic to-do lists into manageable 
                    mini-missions, making your workload feel a lot less overwhelming. With a 
                    little help from your task tracker, you can conquer projects, ace exams, 
                    and still have time for some fun. So grab that planner or app and start 
                    your quest to become the ultimate task-tracking hero! </p>
